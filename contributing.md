# Contributing

When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make via an issue with the owners of this repository before making a change.

## Pull Request Process

1. Ensure any binary files are removed before making a commit (see [.gitignore](./.gitignore)).
2. Visual Studio is currently set to store all compiled binaries in `$(Project Directory)/bin`, and all intermediate files in `$(Project Directory)/bin-int`. Apart from that, only x64 configuration is present (x86 is removed). All the rest of the options are set to Visual Studio defaults. If you add a new project, make sure they follow these guidelines.
3. Make sure a particular data structure is fully implemented before sending a merge request to master branch. Data structures in development have their own separate branches.
